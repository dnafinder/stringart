Stringart: Play with geometry and Bézier's quadratic curve

String art, or pin and thread art, is characterized by an arrangement of colored thread strung between points to form geometric patterns. Though straight lines are formed by the string, the slightly different angles and metric positions at which strings intersect gives the appearance of Bézier curves (as in the mathematical concept of envelope of a family of straight lines). Quadratic Bézier curve are obtained from strings based on two intersecting segments. String art has its origins in the 'curve
stitch' activities invented by Mary Everest Boole at the end of the 19th century to make mathematical ideas more accessible to children. It was popularised as a decorative craft in the late 1960s through kits and books.    

Syntax: 	stringart(varargin)
     
    Properties:
          'Sides' - sides number of polygon you want to use (default = 3)
          'Crossed' - logical value that says if you want to use the perimeter (0 - default) or bisettrices of vertices (1).
          'Density' - The number of pins you want to use for each side default = 40)
          'Color' - 1x3 vector that indicates the colors of the wires (default = [0 0 0] black)
